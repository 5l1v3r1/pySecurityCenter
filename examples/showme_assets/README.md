## Showme Assets and Repositories Script

Showme is a very simple script to show you what the asset list and repository
ids are that the user has access to.  The output is very basic, just to show
how multiple types of information may exist in certian queries.  To use the
script, simple modify the username, password, and host fields to the user
that you wish to run the query as.
